90 Days of Frontend Development ðŸš€

This is my 90-day learning and practice journey to become a stronger frontend developer.
The goal is to improve step by step through daily coding exercises, projects, and challenges.

Over the next 90 days, Iâ€™ll focus on:

Core Web Fundamentals â†’ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Modern Frontend Tools â†’ React, Redux, Tailwind, TypeScript

Problem-Solving Skills â†’ Daily coding challenges

Real-World Projects â†’ Building responsive and scalable apps

Best Practices â†’ Clean code, optimization, and version control

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

Master frontend concepts needed for interviews and real-world projects

Build a strong portfolio of projects

Strengthen consistency, discipline, and coding habits ðŸ’¡

âš¡ One day at a time. One step closer to becoming a frontend pro.
