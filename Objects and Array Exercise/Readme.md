# 📝 JSON & JavaScript Practice Exercises

Today I practiced solving **10 exercises** using a sample JSON object.  
The goal was to strengthen my skills in **objects, arrays, and common JavaScript methods** often asked in interviews.

## 📚 What I Learned

By working on this exercise, I learned and practiced:

1. **Accessing JSON data** using dot notation (`json.users`) and bracket notation (`json["users"]`).
2. Using **`.map()`** to transform arrays and extract specific values.
3. Using **`.filter()`** to select items based on conditions (e.g., users older than 27).
4. Using **`.flatMap()`** to merge arrays inside objects (e.g., collecting all user skills).
5. Adding new properties to objects with the **spread operator (`...`)**.
6. Updating nested data (like setting `isActive` for Bob).
7. Removing specific items from arrays with **`.filter()`**.
8. Understanding the difference between returning arrays vs. objects in `.map()`.
9. Writing **clean and descriptive `console.log` outputs** for debugging.
10. Structuring problems step by step, just like in real coding interviews.

## 🧑‍💻 Exercises Solved

1. Get all user names in an array.  
2. Find all users above 27 years old.  
3. Return only active users.  
4. Count how many skills each user has.  
5. Create an array of all skills across users.  
6. Extract all cities from user addresses.  
7. Find the user who lives in Chennai.  
8. Add a new property `role: "Developer"` to every user.  
9. Update `isActive` to true for Bob.  
10. Delete `"Finance"` from company departments.

## 🚀 Takeaways

- I can confidently manipulate JSON data structures.  
- I reinforced how `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.flatMap()` work in real examples.  
- I learned how to update and restructure objects using the spread operator.  
- These skills are directly useful for **JavaScript interviews** and **real-world projects** like handling API responses.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Practice **nested JSON transformations** (deeply nested objects).  
- Learn how to handle **unique values** using `Set`.  
- Try writing **one-liner solutions** for the same problems.  
- Extend this exercise with **CRUD operations** on the JSON data.
